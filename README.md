# Ship-Management-System

A Ship Management System is a fundamental component of a modern ship system. An SMS is a specialized computer system that automates a wide variety of in-ship tasks, reducing the workload on the ship crew to the point that modern civilian ships no longer carry ship engineers or navigators. A primary function is in-ship management of the ship plan.
So in order to make it easier for the ship crew members as well as passengers we have to make a model of SMS which is convenient to them. This model can easily find all the details of booking of tickets, status and time of ship departure and also the shortest path and its cost. It also displays path between two nodes (or countries).
